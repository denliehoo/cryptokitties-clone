client file contains all the frontend stuff

----
an interface is like an overview of the contract
it is like a sketch of how the contract should look like and should contain.
but, it doesn't contain any implementations.
Hence, whenn coding our Kittycontract.sol, we need those functions/events

We can inherit the contract.
Hence, we won't need to code for things like the requried events
but for functions, we might need to code it manually. We can just copy paste the code over
as in just copy the function into our Kittycontract.sol
e.g. 
    function balanceOf(address owner) external view returns (uint256 balance);
and then we code fully
e.g. 
    function balanceOf(address owner) external view returns (uint256 balance){
        return balance[owner];
    }
then, we also need to create the variables required. we need to do this for all the other functions.
hence just copy paste all the functions (without the events) into the Kittycontract.sol,
then code from there. 

Note: if we don't implement all the functions, we won't be able to deploy the contract.
This is because it doesn't follow the correct standards of an NFT.

note: if we are using ganache, we can just do truffle migrate on the console (need to have ganache open also though)
